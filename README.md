#Intel Image Classification
This project is an image classification task using the Intel Image Classification dataset. The goal is to classify images into specific categories such as buildings, forests, glaciers, mountains, seas, and streets.

#Overview
The repository contains a deep learning model trained on the Intel Image Classification dataset. The model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to classify images into different categories.

#Features
Utilizes a CNN architecture for image classification.
Handles multi-class classification for various environmental scenes.
Implements data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
